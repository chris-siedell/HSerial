     \brief An internal object that controls access to the serial port.
     
     HSerialController instances rely on the access object to interact with the serial port.

     An access object acts as a proxy for a `serial::Serial` object. It is
     created as needed by the HSerialDevice instance. If no objects need to use the serial port
     (i.e. there are no controllers) then there will be no access object.

     The access object also acts as a gatekeeper. It allows only one controller at a time (the 
     active controller) to use the underlying Serial object.
     
     Access objects are owned by HSerialController instances. HSerialDevice keeps a weak reference
     to its access object, and it is from the device object that the controller gets
     its access object.
