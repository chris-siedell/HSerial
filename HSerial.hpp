     \brief A minimal serial controller that mimics the interface of `serial::Serial`.
     
     `HSerial` is a subclass of `HSerialController` that mimics the interface of `serial::Serial`.
     For the most part it can be used just like a `Serial` object, but it must be made "active" 
     before it can use the port (`NotActiveController` exceptions will be thrown otherwise). Being
     active means the controller has exclusive access to the serial port.
