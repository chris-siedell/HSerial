     \brief A lightweight representation of a serial port.
     
     An `HSerialPort` instance represents a specific serial port. A serial port is uniquely
     identified by its device name (e.g. `"COM3"` or `"/dev/ttyS0"`),
     so instances with the same device name represent the same device. Note that
     just because an `HSerialPort` instance exists does not mean that the port is available or even
     exists -- the constructor will accept any non-empty string.
     
     An `HSerialPort` instance merely represents a port. Actually using the port is done with
     a serial port controller (a subclass of `HSerialController`). See HSerial for a
     straightforward implementation of a serial port controller.

         \brief Returns a pointer to the controller which currently controls the serial port.

         Technical details: The current controller is not necessarily the controller that is actually
         using the serial
         port. This is because a controller can use another controller though delegation (see the
         [implementation notes](@ref delegation)). The current controller is the controller
         that is ultimately responsible for delegating to the controller which is -- or was most
         recently -- using the serial port.

         __Warning__: This is a potentially dangerous function in a multithreaded environment. The
         current controller might change or be destroyed from another thread at any time.
         Calling code must be cautious in how it uses the pointer.

         \returns A pointer to the current controller. May be `NULL`.
