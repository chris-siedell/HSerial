    //            about the controller that needs to be made inactive.

    // todo: Consider the idea that a controller may want to base its decision on whether to
    //       become inactive on the identity of the controller making the request. Essentially,
    //       this is the inverse of delegation. Is this sensible? A good idea?

    // todo: Consider the idea of temporary handoff between controllers. But isn't this a

         \brief Sets the timeout for reads and writes using a `Timeout` struct.

         There are two timeout conditions described here:

         - The inter byte timeout:
           - The inter_byte_timeout component of serial::Timeout defines the
             maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, between receiving bytes on
             the serial port that can pass before a timeout occurs.  Setting this
             to zero will prevent inter byte timeouts from occurring.
         - Total time timeout:
           - The constant and multiplier component of this timeout condition,
             for both read and write, are defined in serial::Timeout.  This
             timeout occurs if the total time since the read or write call was
             made exceeds the specified time in milliseconds.
           - The limit is defined by multiplying the multiplier component by the
             number of requested bytes and adding that product to the constant
             component.  In this way if you want a read call, for example, to
             timeout after exactly one second regardless of the number of bytes
             you asked for then set the read_timeout_constant component of
             serial::Timeout to 1000 and the read_timeout_multiplier to zero.
             This timeout condition can be used in conjunction with the inter
             byte timeout condition with out any problems, timeout will simply

         */
        /// \{

        /*!
         \brief Called before the controller is removed from the access list.

         The main purpose of this callback is to give a delegating controller the ability to
         allow or refuse a current controller change. Controllers that don't use delegation probably
         don't need to implement this callback (or any of the adding or removing callbacks).

         The controller can cancel the change by throwing ControllerRefuses.
         This exception will propagate back to the function call that was responsible for initiating
         the change (e.g. makeActive). Any exception will have the same effect, but the
         initiating code may not be expecting anything other than ControllerRefuses.

         This callback is made for every controller on the access list. The current controller
         has its callback made first, but after that the order is undefined.

         Even if the controller accepts the removal by returning normally the change may still
         be cancelled by another controller on the access list, or by the active controller if it
         refuses to become inactive. In this case didCancelRemove() will be called.
         
         So if this callback returns normally then it is guaranteed that either didCancelRemove() or
         didRemove() will be called. This arrangement allows a controller to provisionally cancel an
         action and then complete the cancellation in didRemove(), or reverse the cancellation in
         didCancelRemove().
         
         A controller is allowed to use its delegates during this callback. That is, active
         controller changes -- but not current controller changes -- are allowed in willRemove().

         The default implementation is empty.

        virtual void willRemove() {}

        /*!
         \brief Called when the controller is going to be made inactive.

         __Important__: This is the only callback which must do something. The implementation must
         - block access calls with blockAccessCalls(), and
         - ensure that all access calls have returned (waitForAllAccessCallsToReturn() can be used
         for this).

         Returning without correctly implementing this callback will cause the requested
         transition to fail with a std::logic_error. didCancelMakeInactive will be called in this
         case.

         The controller can cancel the change by throwing ControllerRefuses.
         This exception will propagate back to the function call that was responsible for initiating
         the change (e.g. makeActive). Any exception will have the same effect, but the
         initiating code may not be expecting anything other than ControllerRefuses.

         Guarantee: if this function returns then either didMakeInactive or didCancelMakeInactive
         will be called.

         A controller may require that a mutex be locked throughout the transition -- see HSerial
         for an example. The transition actually occurs after this callback returns. Therefore,
         using a scoped based lock is not sufficient. This is why the two post-transition
         callbacks -- didMakeInactive and didCancelMakeInactive -- exist. A mutex locked in this
         function can be unlocked in those two callbacks.
         (All callbacks are called on the same thread.)

         willRemove() is called before willMakeInactive() for a controller that is simultaneously
         being removed and made inactive. This order is perhaps counterintuitive
         since didAdd() is called before didMakeActive() in the opposite situation.
         This ordering allows a delegating controller to cancel a change even when a
         delegate would allow it.

         If an exception is thrown while the access calls are blocked they will automatically be
         unblocked.

         Here is the default implementation:

         This callback exists so that a controller can have a mutex locked during the transition.
         This allows synchronizing the state of the controller to its isActive setting.
         
         Suppose the controller has a property that must always be a certain value if the controller
         is active. One way to enforce this rule is to have the mutex that protects that property
         locked during the transition. So other threads will never see the property and the

         An anticipated use of this callback is to apply the controller's preferred port settings
         to the serial port (e.g. baudrate), or to start up worker threads.
         
         Access functions are initially blocked when this callback is made (unless unblocked in
         didAdd, which is not recommended -- it will throw an exception -- since a controller
         can be added without being made active).
         
         The callback does not have to unblock the access calls. They will automatically be
         unblocked after this function returns or throws an error.

         Any exception thrown from this callback will propagate back to the calling function
         (e.g. makeActive()). However, even if an exception is thrown the controller will remain
         the active controller. This is reasonable because the code calling makeActive should
         have knowledge of the kinds of exceptions the controller can throw when it is made
         active.
         
         todo: Compare above with willMakeInactive, which can throw errors the makeActive
         caller cannot anticipate. Consider fix -- see notes at top of HSerialController.hpp.
         
         didAdd() is called before didMakeActive() for a controller that has been simultaneously
         added to the access list and made active.

         The default implementation is empty.
